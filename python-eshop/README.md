# eShopOnWeb — Python Edition

A Vibe-coded Python rewrite of the eShopOnWeb storefront. Uses a clean architecture:

**Router → Service → Database Client → SQLite**

The React frontend talks to a FastAPI backend over JSON. Scope includes catalog, favourites, basket, auth, checkout, and orders — no admin, no payment gateway, no product detail page.

## Architecture

```
python-eshop/
├── backend/
│   ├── routers/      # HTTP layer (FastAPI APIRouter)
│   ├── services/     # Business logic
│   ├── db/           # DatabaseClient + schema + seed
│   └── models/       # Pydantic schemas + dataclasses
└── frontend/         # Vite + React + Tailwind SPA
```

| Python layer | Original C# project | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `routers/` | `Web/` pages & controllers | HTTP, validation, auth headers |
| `services/` | `ApplicationCore/` | Basket merge, checkout rules |
| `db/client.py` | `Infrastructure/` | All SQL queries |
| SQLite file | SQL Server CatalogDb | Persistent storage |

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.14)
- Node.js 18+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — required for the backend

## Quick start

Open two terminals.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd python-eshop/backend
uv sync
uv run python run.py
```

- API: http://127.0.0.1:8765
- Swagger docs: http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs
- Static product images: http://127.0.0.1:8765/static/images/products/

### Running the tests

```bash
cd python-eshop/backend
uv run pytest
uv run pip-audit
uv run pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

The suite boots the API in-process against a throwaway SQLite database, so it never touches your `eshop.db`, needs no running server and makes no network calls.

`/api/health` reports process liveness. `/api/health/ready` returns success only while the database responds and is the correct endpoint for traffic admission. SQLite keeps the workshop simple but intentionally limits the app to a single authoritative instance; see [`../docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md) before attempting horizontal scale.

> **Note:** Do not use bare `uvicorn main:app --reload` — that defaults to port 8000, which may already be in use. Always use `uv run python run.py`.

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd python-eshop/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- App: http://127.0.0.1:4321

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/static` to the backend.

## Shopping flow

1. Browse the catalog — filter by brand/type, paginate (10 items per page)
2. Add items to basket — works anonymously via `X-Basket-Id` stored in `localStorage`
3. Login or register — anonymous basket merges into your account
4. Save products as account-private Favourites and return to them later
5. Checkout — review order, click **Pay now** (uses a hardcoded shipping address like the original)
6. View orders — **My Orders** in the header
