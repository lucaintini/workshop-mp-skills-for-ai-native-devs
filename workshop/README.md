# Facilitator Guide

Detailed run sheet for the workshop summarised in the [top-level README](../README.md). Pair this with [presentation.html](presentation.html), which carries the slides for each segment below, and hand attendees [handout.html](handout.html) — a self-contained, interactive participant workbook that mirrors this run sheet with reflection prompts for every segment. It autosaves answers to the browser's local storage only and lets each attendee export their own notes as Markdown at the end; nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## Suggested pacing

The session runs 2.5–3 hours end to end, including the practical exercise. Segments are listed in order; adjust the practical steps to the time remaining rather than rushing the discussion segments.

## 1. Warm-up

Poll the room (via Particify or similar) on their current experience with AI coding tools, agents, and skills — comfort level, what they've tried, and any concerns. Keep this live and visible; it sets the baseline for the "what went wrong" discussion later and gives you a read on the room's skill level.

## 2. Introduce the scenario

Walk through the [scenario](../README.md#scenario): a non-technical client vibe-coded a Python rewrite of their legacy C# store, it mostly works, but it's buggy, and they want it fixed without a rewrite.

Open the app locally (see the [python-eshop README](../python-eshop/README.md)) and let attendees click through the shopping flow so the scenario is concrete before the discussion.

## 3. Retro: what went wrong

Poll the room again: why do they think the vibe coding went wrong, and how would they have approached it differently? Let a few people share before moving on — this discussion is what makes the skills pitch land in the next segment.

## 4. Introduce the skills approach

Introduce Matt Pocock's skill set for Claude Code and how it addresses the failure modes just discussed — structured workflows instead of unstructured prompting — as well as where it still falls short (it doesn't replace understanding the codebase or good judgement about scope).

Cover, at a minimum:

- **Ask Matt** — a routing skill that points you to whichever skill fits your situation.
- **Grill with Docs** *(recommended for every attendee)* — a structured interview that sharpens a plan or design and produces artifacts (ADRs, a glossary) as it goes. It's worth treating as close to mandatory: it forces attendees to understand the codebase before touching it, and everyone leaves with a real artifact rather than just a demo.
- Two or three more selected from **Triage**, **Wayfinder**, **Code Review**, **Implement**, and **Prototype**, depending on room size and time. Don't attempt a tour of the full skill set — going deep on a handful beats a shallow pass over many.

## 5. Practical component

### Step 1 — Set up the skills

Attendees install the skills selected in segment 4. Have them discuss or write down (time permitting) what the setup actually did — the goal is that they understand what got installed, not that they just followed steps blindly.

Open the TOML header of a couple of skills together and use it to explain:

- Skills run manually, not automatically — the model chooses to invoke them, or the attendee does.
- Skills are an augmentation on top of the model, not a replacement for it.
- Skills load progressively (the header first, full instructions only when invoked), which is why context management matters when composing several of them.

### Step 2 — Triage a bug

Attendees pick a bug from the client's app and work it through a triage skill. Use this segment to discuss harnesses and scaling — how the same workflow holds up whether you're fixing one bug or working through a backlog.

### Step 3 — Implement the fix

Attendees implement the fix and push it to a branch, using the skills set up in Step 1 (e.g. an implement/code-review skill for the build-and-check loop).

### Step 4 — Discuss and reflect

Close the practical component with a group discussion: what did the skills catch that plain prompting wouldn't have, where did they get in the way, and what would attendees change about their setup going forward.

## 6. Beyond today

If time remains, point attendees at other skills worth exploring on their own — for example Grill with Docs' broader family, Teach, and Wayfinder — and encourage them to keep experimenting after the workshop.
